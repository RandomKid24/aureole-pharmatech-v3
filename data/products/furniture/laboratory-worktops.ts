    description: "Made of 16mm thick laboratory grade Compact Laminate Boards (Max Resistance). The panels are made from approved and tested raw materials, compressed under high pressure, resulting in a unique, homogenous panel without joints. Fully enclosed and therefore resistant against the penetration of moisture. The surface is protected with a dual cured urethane acrylic coating which makes it unaffected by solvents and chemicals in extreme working conditions of the laboratory. Easy to clean and disinfect.",
